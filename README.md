# moblib
Mathematical Objects Library (moblib) is a library dedicated to the creation and manipulation of graphic objects in an easy way.

This project is a combination of several projects of mine to create a library that allows the programmer to create graphical interfaces (structure of menus, windows, etc.), as well as graphical objects (characters, maps, animations) and manipulate them as they wish, as well. enabling the creation from games to professional programs.

Project pillars:
here I will address what will be the path I want to follow and what is the ideal to think about when developing this library.

* The library will be developed exclusively in c/c++

* Speed, optimization above all, always thinking first about the way with the lowest computational cost to achieve a goal.

* Recursiveness, trying to design as much as possible in such a way that what is created can cover all the existing forms and needs of use without compromising performance.

* Linearity, maintaining a standard programming and operating mechanics, enabling ease of learning, maintenance, understanding and organization of the library.

* Compatibility, always try to keep a cogido that does not exclude old compilations to be able to supply projects without the fear of compromise but without hurting the above ideals.

Obs: The project is being rewritten from my old projects, I appreciate any critical feedback that helps me improve as well as existing bugs and ideas to improve.

Obs: Anyone who wants to participate in the project will leave my discord here for us to talk: "BomDia#9401"
